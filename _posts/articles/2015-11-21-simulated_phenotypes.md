# A simulated dataset

The intent is to begin to get feedback on some rough sketches of what some data products might look like.

To this end, I have simulated the type of data that a sensor might observe, along with some of the underlying environmental drivers and physiological traits.

Note that there will be numerical artifacts, quasi-principled error terms, and liberal re-application of core concepts for the purposes of developing these datasets. 

All of these simulated datasets are released CC-BY-0: do with as you please, but these are not production quality - just trying to meet demand and begin getting feedback.

### A note on variable names

I have used the names currently used in BETYdb.org/variables, along with names inspired by the more standardized naming Climate Forecasting conventions. However, at this point this is a very early pre-release, and comments on how such data should be formatted and accessed can be discussed in issue #18.

# Design of Simulation Experiment


227 lines grown at each of three sites along a N-S transect in Illinois over five years (2021-2025). 

## Time Span (2021-2025) 

These are historic data, but the years have been changed to emphasize the point that these are not real data. The years have been chosen to select climate extremes. Two years were dry, two were wet, and one was average.

| year | drought index |
|-----|-----|
| 2021 | wet |
| 2022 | dry |
| 2023 | normal |
| 2024 | wet |
| 2025 | dry |


### Sites

These are approximate locations used to query the meteorological and soil data used in the simulations. 
 
| site name | latitude | longitude | 
|-------|------|------|
| north | 42.0 | -88.5 |
| central | 40.0 | -88.5 |
| south | 37.0 | -88.5 |

Each site has four replicate fields: A, B, C, D. This simulated dataset assumes each field within a site has similar, but different meteorology (e.g., as if they were all in the same county). 

## Meteorology

## Genotypes

Two-hundred and twenty-seven lines were grown at each site. They are identified uniquely by an integer in the range [9915:10141]

## Phenotypes

The phenotypes associated with each genotype is in the file `phenotypes.csv`. 

These 'phenotypes' are used as input parameters to the simulation model. We often refer to these as 'traits' (as opposed to biomass or growth rates, which are states and proceses). In this example, we assume that 'phenotypes' are time-invariant.

## Simulated Sensor Data

This dataset includes what a sensor might observe, daily for five years during the growing season.

OK. A sensor won't observe roots or rhizomes. Furthermore, Sorghum doesn't have rhizomes. The simulated biology is a little different.
