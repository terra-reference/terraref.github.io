# Manage Data Collected by Robots to Improve Crops

## Project Description

This position will assist in the management of data for the TERRA-MEPP (Mobile Energy-Crop Phenotyping Platform) project.
TERRA-MEPP will be a low-cost, tactical, semi-autonomous, ground-based vehicle that plant breeders can use to rapidly identify plants with desirable traits.
Its multiple sensors will collect detailed field data at an unprecedented scale that will then be analyzed using high-throughput analytical strategies to determine the genetic basis of these traits and identify promising genotypes for crop improvemnt.

For more information, see the [TERRA MEPP Brochure](/assets/TERRA_MEPP_Brochure_110315.pdf) and the [TERRA Reference Data and Computing Pipeline](http://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu) project page.

## Job Description

Multiple openings for talented undergraduates interested in data science, digital agriculture, and robotic sensing.
The sucessful candidate will work with researchers at NCSA, IGB, Crop Sciences, and Civil Engineering to develop a pipeline to process and faciliate the cross-disciplinary exchange of data and information.
Duties will include development and automation of data extraction modules for TERRA Data and Computing pipeline using an open-source programming language such as R or Python.

All employees will be trained in the principles of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) including _Best practices for scientific computing_ outlined by [Wilson et al 2014](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745).

### Required Skills

Knowledge of Python, R, or similar language for managing numeric, textual, and image-based data. Must have excellent writing and communication skills.

### Preferred Skills

Course work or experience in computer vision, geospatial information systems (GIS), computational biology, ontologies, and / or informatics.
Experience using Rmarkdown, PostGIS, OpenCV, GDAL, and/or REST APIs preferred.

## To apply:

Please send a brief statement of interest, resume, and level of FWS support if applicable to Ank Michielsen [michiels@illinois.edu](mailto:michiels@illinois.edu) with subject “TERRA-MEPP Informatics Position”.
